## About Us

Perley is a rock band hailing from Toronto, with roots in Barrie, Nova Scotia, Alberta and California. Starting in 2017, the band grew out of jam sessions to explore singer-songwriter David Perley’s original compositions. This group of music lovers/buffs includes Ryan MacDonald on guitar and synthesizer, Tim Miller on drums, Pat Farrell on bass, and Dave on vocals and guitar. Perley pairs soulful melodies and lyrics with sophisticated and hard rocking percussion, conjuring the atmospheres and tones of indie, shoegaze, punk and progressive rock. Perley has performed at locations in Toronto and Stella, Ontario.
